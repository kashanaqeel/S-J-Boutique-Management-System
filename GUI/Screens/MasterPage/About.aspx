                    We are a small online clothing business. By small, we mean you will most likely be hearing from us personally in regards to customer service, 
       and hopefully we'll be able to get to know you better through our LIVE product sales we host every week on our APP and Facebook.
                </p>

                    At the boutique we feature upcoming fashion must haves with a modern boho flare. Our vibe is CLASSY with a splash of SASSY!
We pride ourselves on offering great customer service while providing our customers with quality fashion forward products at an affordable price. 
At S & J, we aspire to help create a society of strong, beautiful women who resonate with being free-spirited and who have a love for expressing themselves through fashion.
